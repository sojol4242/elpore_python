# python has no command for specific data type of variables. just need to be naming and assign values and that it to deal with variables



x=6 # int type
y=7.36 # float type
name="Python is amazing" # string type

print("X = ",x,"Y = ",y)
print(name)
 
## Casting: for specify the data type of a variable
x=int(x)
y=float(y)
name=str(name)
print("X = ",x,"Y = ",y)
print(name)
# Get the data type of a variable by calling type() function
print("Type of variable ")
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(name))
# Variable Naming
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
